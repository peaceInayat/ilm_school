The curriculum allows for flexibility to differentiate the instruction to meet the needs of each individual because we recognize that each student is unique with their individual learning needs. Our low student/teacher ratio enables our teachers to tailor the educational experience to each child. Our ultimate goal is for every student to excel in all their future endeavors to become a Global Leader. Our curriculum objectives are adopted from the standards published by the Board of Education.
